# emojione-cs

A C# implementation of Emojione's lib for converting Unicode emoji characters to :shortnames: and :shortnames: to emoji images etc. 

Some code is generated from [emoji.json](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione/blob/master/emoji.json) in the official Emojione repo and you should make sure it is updated before regenerating it.
